# Acknowledgments

Thank you to Valentin Lorentz for raising questions about design choices
and pointing out an important shortcoming in how GPG digital signatures were used
in the initial implementation of the Hidos library (version 0.3) [@hidos:0.3].


# Further Reading

* This specification is heavily influenced by the concept of *intrinsic identifier* and
  related concepts discussed in
  [@cosmo_referencing_2020] [@dicosmo:hal-01865790].

* For a discussion on various concepts and proposed terminology regarding persistent
  identifiers, see [@kunze_persistence_2017]. According to this proposed terminology,
  a DSI is a persistent identifier (PID) that is "frozen" and "waxing" with
  "intraversioned" and "extraversioned" PIDs depending on the edition number.


# Changes

## From Edition 1 to 2

* The term "digital succession" has been updated to "document succession."

## From Edition 1.2

* References to SSH signing keys have replaced mentions of GPG/PGP signing keys.
