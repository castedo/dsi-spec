    **DOCUMENT TYPE**: Living Technical Specification

    A Document Succession Identifier (DSI) in a bibliographic reference facilitates
    the long-term retrieval of a cited document from any compatible website.
    A DSI can refer to either a succession of document snapshots
    or a specific document snapshot.
    This lets readers discover document updates
    while preserving access to earlier snapshots.

    This technical specification
    formally defines the textual format of a DSI and
    outlines the concept of a document succession.

# Specification

## Document Successions

A document succession contains document snapshots,
each a static collection of bytes identifiable by a
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) [@enwiki:git] hash or an equivalent
[Software Hash Identifier (SWHID)](https://swhid.org).
A snapshot can be either a file or a directory encoded for compatibility with
Git, SWHIDs, and the
[Software Heritage Archive](https://softwareheritage.org) [@cosmo_referencing_2020].

Each snapshot in a document succession is assigned at least one fixed edition number.
Edition number assignments are immutable.
Document successions are updated only by adding new edition numbers.

An edition number can be a single non-negative integer or a multilevel
tuple of two to four non-negative integers.

In a document succession, no fixed edition number can be a prefix of another.
For example, if `1.2.3` is a fixed edition number, then `1.2` cannot be a fixed
edition number.
However, a non-fixed edition number can identify a dynamic sequence of editions,
such as `1.2` identifying the sequence `1.2.1`, `1.2.2`, and `1.2.3`.

Multilevel edition numbers resemble software package release numbers
(for example, software release 2.19.2).
Larger integers represent newer editions
within the same level of an edition number.
This specification does not assign semantic meaning
to specific levels in edition numbers.

The integer `0` has a special meaning in edition numbers.
An edition number with any zero component is considered *unlisted*.
Furthermore, the last component integer of a fixed edition number must not be zero.

## Textual Representation of a DSI

The textual representation of a Document Succession Identifier (DSI) consists of a base
identifier, which may be optionally followed by a slash and an edition number.
The edition number is composed of one to four non-negative
integers, each less than one thousand, and separated by periods.

### Examples

Base DSI of this specification:
: `1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo`

DSI of the first edition:
: `1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo/1`

DSI of the first subedition of the first edition:
: `1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo/1.1`


### Base DSI as a Git Hash

As of 2023, DSIs are implemented using
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) [@enwiki:git].
Future implementations may use different hashing mechanisms,
as long as the risk of identifier collision remains acceptably low.
In a Git-based implementation,
the base DSI is calculated from the initial commit of a document succession.
Git-compatible software calculates a 20-byte binary hash,
which is typically represented as a 40-digit hexadecimal string.
For DSIs, this hash is represented by a 27-character string
using the standard base64url format (RFC 4648)[@rfc4648].


### Formal Definition in Extended Backusâ€”Naur Form

Note that `N * [ x ]` matches zero to N repetitions of `x`.

```
dsi ::= [ prefix ] base_dsi [ "/" [ edition_number ] ] ;
base_dsi ::= ( 26 * b64u_digit ) b64u_digit27 ;
edition_number ::= int_number ( 3 * [ "." int_number ] ) ;
int_number ::= "0" | pos_dec_digit ( 3 * [ dec_digit ] );
pos_dec_digit := "1" ... "9" ;
dec_digit := "0" | pos_dec_digit;
b64u_digit ::= "A" ... "Z" | "a" ... "z" | dec_digit | "-" | "_" ;
b64u_digit27 ::= "A" | "E" | "I" | "M" | "Q" | "U" | "Y" | "c" |
                 "g" | "k" | "o" | "s" | "w" | "0" | "4" | "8" ;
```

The optional `prefix` is unspecified and is described in the discussion section that
follows.

# Discussion

## Optional DSI Prefix

Users may choose to use a DSI with or without
a prefix, depending on the application context.
An intuitive choice for a prefix is `dsi:`, which mirrors the acronym "DSI".
For added convenience, some websites provide a URL that serves as a DSI prefix.

As of 2023, the [Hidos](https://pypi.org/project/hidos/) tool supports DSIs
both with and without the `dsi:` prefix in its `find` subcommand. For example:

```bash
$ hidos find dsi:1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo
gh-703611066 https://github.com/digital-successions/1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo.git
```

As of 2023, the website `perm.pub` supports a URL-based prefix `https://perm.pub/`,
as demonstrated in the following example:

```bash
$ firefox https://perm.pub/1wFGhvmv8XZfPx0O5Hya2e9AyXo
```

## Future Extensions

To accommodate future enhancements,
there are three methods to extend the textual representation of a DSI:

* Use a character that is neither a slash (`/`) nor one of the 64 base64url characters.
* Vary the number of characters from 27.
* Make the 27th character one of the 48 base64url characters that never appear
  as the last character in a base64url encoding of 40 bytes
  (that is, any base64url character other than
  `A`, `E`, `I`, `M`, `Q`, `U`, `Y`, `c`, `g`, `k`, `o`, `s`, `w`, `0`, `4`, or `8`).

## Use of Base64url Over Hexadecimal

The textual identifier uses "base64url" (Base 64 with a URL and filename safe alphabet) as
specified in RFC 4648 [@rfc4648].
Both base64url and hexadecimal have their advantages and disadvantages.

The main downside to base64url is its susceptibility to copy
errors when the copying process relies on human sight.
Certain fonts make a poor distinction between some characters.
For example, some popular sans serif fonts make no visual distinction
between capital 'I' and lowercase 'l'.

However, creators of a new document succession are not obligated to use
a specific DSI.
If a DSI is deemed unsuitable, generating a new one is straightforward.

The main advantage of base64url is its brevity,
requiring only 27 characters compared to 40 in hexadecimal.
Since DSIs are used in contexts similar to DOIs,
a 27-character identifier is more likely to be acceptable,
as it is comparable to the length of a long DOI.
Additionally, a shorter ID is more suitable for display on mobile devices,
reducing the likelihood of
truncation, horizontal scrolling, or the need for very small fonts.

The choice of base64url is partly made on the belief that
the following technology trends mitigate the copy-by-human-sight issue:

1) Use of hyperlinks, copy-and-paste, and QR codes.

2) Tools that generate websites and PDFs with customizable fonts.

3) Human-to-computer interfaces incorporating
   features like autocomplete and typo correction to mitigate input errors.

Thank you to Valentin Lorentz for raising questions about design choices
and pointing out an important shortcoming in how GPG digital signatures were used
in the initial implementation of the Hidos library (version 0.3) [@hidos:0.3].


# Further Reading

* This specification is heavily influenced by the concept of *intrinsic identifier* and
  related concepts discussed in
  [@cosmo_referencing_2020] [@dicosmo:hal-01865790].

* For a discussion on various concepts and proposed terminology regarding persistent
  identifiers, see [@kunze_persistence_2017]. According to this proposed terminology,
  a DSI is a persistent identifier (PID) that is "frozen" and "waxing" with
  "intraversioned" and "extraversioned" PIDs depending on the edition number.


# Changes

## From Edition 1 to 2

* The term "digital succession" has been updated to "document succession."

## From Edition 1.2

* References to SSH signing keys have replaced mentions of GPG/PGP signing keys.
