# Use of Base64url Rather than Hexadecimal

The textual identifier is in base64url (Base64 with a URL and filename safe alphabet) as
specified in RFC 4648 [@rfc4648]. Both this format and hexadecimal have pros and cons.

As mentioned in the introduction to the textual representation, there is no obligation
to use the Document Succession Identifier (DSI) generated by a new document
succession. If a DSI is unacceptable to the creator of a new document succession, a new
DSI can be easily generated. Helper tools could perform this function for users by
default.

The main con to base64url is that it can contain characters that are more prone to copy
errors when transmitted via human sight. Certain fonts and handwriting can make poor
or no distinction between certain character pairs. For example, some popular sans serif
fonts make no visual distinction between capital I and lowercase l.

The main pro to base64url is that it is 27 characters rather than 40.
Given that DSIs are used in contexts similar to DOIs, it is likely more acceptable to
adopters to use 27 characters, which is very typical for a long DOI, rather than 40
characters.
Displaying an ID of 27 characters rather than 40 characters also fits better on web
pages rendered on mobile devices. 27 characters are less likely to be hidden by showing
ellipsis, horizontal scroll regions, or shrunk into extremely small fonts.

This design decision is partly made on the belief that the copy-via-human-sight issue is
increasingly mitigated by a few technology trends:

1) Computer systems are relied upon more and more via more reliable copying mechanisms
such as clicking on hyperlinks, copy-and-paste, and QR codes instead of visual copying
and handwriting.

2) Websites tend to switch to using appropriate fonts for code like base64url IDs when
output into HTML. The same applies to tools that automatically produce PDFs from
computer data.

3) Human-to-computer interfaces, such as input fields of Internet-connected software,
tend to add features like autocomplete and search disambiguation for typos when
sufficient need arises for such a feature.
